# City Checker

This is a basic project called City Checker that demonstrates how to fetch and display basic information about a city using an API. The primary purpose of this project is to learn and practice making API calls and handling the responses in a simple web app.



## Features

- Fetches basic city information such as:
- City name
- Local time
- Time zone
- Temperature 


## Technologies Used:

  - HTML, CSS: For the frontend design and layout.
-  JavaScript: For making API requests and dynamically updating the UI.
- WeatherAPI: Used for fetching city-related data (even though the app currently shows only basic city details)




## Project Purpose

The main goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with fetching data from an API and dynamically displaying it on a web page. This project is not meant for real-world use but is a learning exercise.
## Note

You might notice that my WeatherAPI key is visible in the JavaScript file. Since this project is just for learning purposes, please ignore this. Normally, for production apps, it's crucial to secure API keys properly.
